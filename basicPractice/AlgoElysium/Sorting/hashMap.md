# Hashmap

---
This is just a sort notes for the shake of solving problem instead of formally researched notes so refer with caution.

* WHat is hashing?
  when you give a key, the map runs it through a hash function and produce a number (hash code).
  
  Syntax

```java
Map<keyDataType, valueDataType> mapName = new Hashmap<>() //<> this is used to refer to just saying take data type inference from prev instance

mapName.put(key, value) // put the value in hashmap

mapName.get(key) //retrive the value

mapName.containsKey/Value(key/value) // to check it's existence

mapName.remove(key) // self explanatory

mapName.size()

mapName.clear() //delete all

map.isEmpty() // check if it is empty

```
