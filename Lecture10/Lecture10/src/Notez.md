# Time and Space Complexity

There are two ways of finding it 
1. Experimental way
2. Asymptotic notation

## Experimental way
Machine dependent -> faster your processor the faster your code run, so enviromental codition dependent so not really standard.

## Asymptotic notation

## How to find complexity of any code
